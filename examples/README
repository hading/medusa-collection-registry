This directory is for relevant examples or sample files.

- schema.xml and solrconfig.xml are examples of how solr (3.5) can be
configured to work with fedora (3.4.2). These reside in the solr
installation

- solr.xml is an example of how to configure tomcat to use a solr
  installation

- The akubra-llstore.xml.* files are examples of how to set up fedora
  (3.4.2) to work with the Dell DX / Caringo storage. Note that these
  change a little bit for fedora 3.5. Note that if you're using
  authentication then a section needs to be added for that as
  well. We'll try to drop in an example showing both once we're up on
  such an installation.
