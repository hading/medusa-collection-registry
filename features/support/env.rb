# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
#
ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false

#make sure database is seeded before loading test code - this is necessary because some of the factories, etc. assume
#that the seeded stuff is there
require File.join(Rails.root, 'db', 'seeds.rb')

#make sure database is seeded before each test - because we need to truncate for some of the tests (javascript) this
#is necessary. This should also be possible by using except: with the truncation strategy, but I couldn't get that to work

  load File.join(Rails.root, 'db', 'seeds.rb') if StaticPage.count == 0

# You may also want to configure DatabaseCleaner to use different strategies for certain features and scenarios.
# See the DatabaseCleaner documentation for details. Example:
#
Before('@no-txn,@selenium,@culerity,@celerity,@javascript') do
  # { except: [:widgets] } may not do what you expect here
  # as tCucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy overrides
  # this setting.
  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
end

Before('~@no-txn', '~@selenium', '~@culerity', '~@celerity', '~@javascript') do
  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
end


# Possible values are :truncation and :transaction
# The :transaction strategy is faster, but might give you threading problems.
# See https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/blob/master/features/choose_javascript_database_strategy.feature
