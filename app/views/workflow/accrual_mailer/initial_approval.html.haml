  The automated accrual of the staging path #{@workflow_accrual.staging_path} to
  the cfs directory #{@workflow_accrual.cfs_directory.relative_path} is pending.

- if file_group = @workflow_accrual.cfs_directory.file_group
  %p
    This belongs to the file group #{file_group.title}, collection #{file_group.collection.title}
    and repository #{file_group.repository.title}.

  You may proceed or abort the accrual from the medusa dashboard.

- if serious_conflicts.present?
  %p
    You have the following duplicated files where the checksums disagree. From the Medusa
    dashboard you may either abort the ingest or refer it to a Medusa admin
    for evaluation if you wish to overwrite the affected files.

    - serious_conflicts.each do |conflict|
      %li= conflict.path

- nonserious_conflicts = @workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_conflicts.not_serious
- if nonserious_conflicts.present?
  %p
    You have the following duplicated files where the checksums agree. These are not
    considered serious and if there are no other conflicts you may proceed normally.
